"""
In this example, the code uses the Iris dataset and a simple linear regression model as the interpretable model. For a more robust implementation, you can replace the linear regression model with other interpretable models and adjust the counterfactual instance generation process to suit your specific use case. Additionally, more sophisticated feature importance techniques and thresholding methods can be applied depending on the complexity of the problem and the black-box model being used.

Keep in mind that implementing a full-fledged Contrastive LIME algorithm requires more considerations, such as handling categorical features, handling different types of models, and possibly using different similarity measures for sampling and perturbing the data. If you plan to use Contrastive LIME in real-world applications, it's advisable to explore existing libraries and packages that might have more comprehensive implementations.

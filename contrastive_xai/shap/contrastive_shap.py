"""
In this code outline, we use shap.Explainer from the shap library to compute SHAP values for the original and counterfactual instances. The function contrastive_shap_values computes the contrastive SHAP values by taking the difference between the SHAP values of the original and counterfactual instances.

Keep in mind that this is a simplified outline, and you may need to customize and extend the code depending on your specific machine learning model, data, and counterfactual generation method.

Please ensure that you have a proper understanding of the shap library and its usage with your machine learning model for accurate and meaningful explanations. Additionally, SHAP computations can be computationally intensive, especially for large models and datasets, so consider using appropriate sampling techniques and optimizations to handle complexity effectively.
